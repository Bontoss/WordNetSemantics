# WordNet Semantics
The WordNet Semantics Project is a C++ implementation developed as part of an Algorithms course project. It provides functionalities for semantic analysis using the WordNet lexical database.

## Description
This project leverages the WordNet lexical database to perform semantic analysis on textual data. It includes modules for parsing synsets, hypernyms, relations, and outcast queries from input files. Additionally, it implements algorithms to calculate semantic distances between words and find outlier words based on their semantic relationships.

## Features
* **Parsing Modules:** Parses input files containing synsets, hypernyms, relations, and outcast queries.
* **Semantic Distance Calculation:** Calculates the semantic distance between words using dynamic programming.
* **Outcast Identification:** Identifies outlier words in a given set based on their semantic relationships with other words.
* **Efficient Algorithms:** Utilizes efficient algorithms to handle large datasets with optimal time complexity.
