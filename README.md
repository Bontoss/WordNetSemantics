# WordNet Semantics
## Description
The WordNet Semantics Project, developed in C++ for an Algorithms course, provides functionalities for semantic analysis using the WordNet lexical database. It includes modules for parsing synsets, hypernyms, relations, and outcast queries from input files, and implements algorithms to calculate semantic distances between words and identify outlier words based on their semantic relationships.

## Features
* **Parsing Modules:** Parses input files containing synsets, hypernyms, relations, and outcast queries.
* **Semantic Distance Calculation:** Calculates the semantic distance between words using dynamic programming.
* **Outcast Identification:** Identifies outlier words in a given set based on their semantic relationships with other words.
* **Efficient Algorithms:** Utilizes efficient algorithms to handle large datasets with optimal time complexity.
